In this repository, you can find the initial transcription work for 10 years' worth of data. 
The data pertains to species, which represent molecules and structures and are identified by a primary key known as number_id. 
Each species entry is associated with a name and formula.
The UV_VIS section contains information about spectroscopy experiments that categorize the molecules. 
Additionally, the molecule information is interconnected through the number_id, enabling easy querying and retrieval of related data.
